# Securin - Java Developer Assignment

This project is a backend RESTful API developed as a technical assignment for the Java Developer Intern role at Securin. The objective was to parse a CPE data feed, store the data in a relational database, and expose it via a paginated and searchable API using Java and the Spring Boot ecosystem.

## My Approach & Key Decisions

This assignment presented several real-world challenges that required strategic decisions to deliver a robust and functional backend solution.


* **Handling a Large Data Source:** The provided `official-cpe-dictionary_v2.3.xml.gz` file is a very large (over 700MB uncompressed) data source. To parse this data efficiently without consuming excessive memory, I chose to implement a **StAX (Streaming API for XML) parser**. Unlike a DOM parser which loads the entire file into memory, a StAX parser reads the XML as a stream of events, which is the industry-standard approach for handling large XML documents.

* **Database Evolution:** I initially prototyped the persistence layer with MongoDB. However, to better implement the complex, multi-parameter search functionality required by the `/api/cpes/search` endpoint, I migrated the database to **MySQL**. This allowed me to write custom, efficient JPQL queries in the repository layer to handle the specific filtering logic.

* **Focus on Backend Excellence:** As my specialization is in backend development, I focused all my efforts on creating a high-quality, fully functional, and well-documented API. To facilitate testing and interaction, I have integrated Swagger UI.

* **On Using AI Tools:** Throughout this learning-intensive project, I utilized AI-powered tools as a research and learning aid to understand new concepts, such as the intricacies of StAX parsing, ensuring that all final logic and implementation were my own.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

* **Data Persistence:** A robust data layer built with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to store CPE data in a MySQL database.
* **RESTful API:** A complete set of API endpoints built with Spring Boot.
* **Pagination:** The `/api/cpes` endpoint correctly implements pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
* **Complex Search:** The `/api/cpes/search` endpoint supports dynamic, multi-parameter filtering using custom queries.
* **API Documentation:** Integrated **Swagger UI** for live, interactive API documentation and testing.

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

#### 1. Database Setup
This project uses a MySQL database.
* Please create a new database in your local MySQL instance.
* In the `src/main/resources` folder, open the `application.properties` file.
* Update the following properties with your local database credentials:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    ```
* Hibernate (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`) will automatically create the necessary tables when the application starts.

#### 2. Run the Application
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in your IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ).
* Run the main application class `SecurinAssesmentApplication.java`.
* The application will start on the default port `8080`.
